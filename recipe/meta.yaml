    summary: Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model
    description: |
        The Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model (WISDEMÂ®) is a
        set of models for assessing overall wind plant cost of energy (COE). The models
        use wind turbine and plant cost and energy production as well as financial
        models to estimate coe and other wind plant system attributes. It is built
        in OpenMDAO.
