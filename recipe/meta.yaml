  summary: Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model
  description: |
    The Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model (WISDEMÂ®) is a
    set of models for assessing overall wind plant cost of energy (COE). The models
    use wind turbine and plant cost and energy production as well as financial
    models to estimate coe and other wind plant system attributes. WISDEM is developed by
    the National Renewable Energy Lab, on top of NASA's OpenMDAO library.
